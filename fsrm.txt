File Server Resource Manager is a feature set in the File and Storage Services server role in Windows Server that helps administrators classify and manage stored data in file servers.
There are five main features in FSRM. 
  File Classification Infrastructure - automates the processes behind classification so administrators have a more effective and insightful way to manage data. 
  File Management Tasks - helps administrators apply conditional actions or policies based on how they are classified.
  File screening management - helps administrators control what kinds of files end users are allowed to store on file servers. 
  Quota management - helps administrators limit how much space can be used for folders and volumes and can also be applied for new folders and volumes. 
  Storage reports - helps administrators identify disk usage trends and how data is classified.


File Server Resource Manager had two major changes with the Windows Server 2012 R2 release. Administrators can now set a maximum number of files for storage reports and can clear any classification properties that don't apply to a file that's been updated.
